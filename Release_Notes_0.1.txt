Release 0.1 of pySlipQt is early-release and is therefore BETA software.  It is
being released at this early stage so anyone interested in pySlipQt can run the
"pyslipqt_demo.py" program and get comfortable with the way pySlipQt works.

This release has these warnings:

1. Little testing has been done, so please report any errors to me at 
   rzzzwilson@gmail.com and attach the "pyslipqt.log" file.

2. "Box selection" (a multi-selection made by dragging a select box) doesn't
   work at the moment, but it will!

3. Wrap-around of tiles doesn't work yet, but I *hope* to have it workingi even
   though it will come with some limitations..

4. The included GMT tileset is very old and has a different zoom compared to any
   tiles from the 'net, such as OSM tiles, for instance.  I hope to fix this
   later.  The GMT tiles can still be used an example of how to use locally
   generated tiles.

The GMT example tileset is included in the "examples" subdirectory.  The
gmt_local_tiles.py tileset code assumes that the zip file has been unzipped in
the user's home directory (ie, ~/gmt_local_tiles).  If you put the tiles in any
other place, please make the appropriate changes in gmt_local_tiles.py.

See the API documentation for the details on how to use pySlipQt.  The
demonstration program "examples/pyslipqt_demo.py" does work if you run it
from the examples directory.  It does not require that the pySlipQt package has
been installed, though it also works if pySlipQt has been installed..
