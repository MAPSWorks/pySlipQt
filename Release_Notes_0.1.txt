Release 0.1.0 of pySlipQt is an early-release and is therefore BETA software.

This release has these warnings:

1. Little testing has been done, so please report any errors and try to include
   the pyslipqt.log file.

2. "Box selection" (a multi-selection dragging a select box) doesn't work at the
   moment, but it will sometime.

3. Wrap-around of tiles doesn't work yet, but I *hope* to have it working.

4. The included GMT tileset is very old and has a different zoom compared to any
   tiles from the 'net, such as OSM tiles, for instance.  I hope to fix this
   later.  The GMT tiles can still be used an example of how to use locally
   generated tiles.

The GMT example tileset is included in the pyslipqt/examples directory.  The
gmt_local_tiles.py tileset code assumes that the zip file has been unzipped in
the user's home directory (ie, ~/gmt_tiles).  If you put the tiles in any other
place, please make the appropriate changes in gmt_local_tiles.py.

See the API documentation for the details on how to use pySlipQt.  The
demonstration program pyslipqt/examples/pyslipqt_demo.py does work if you run it
from the examples directory.  It does not require that the pySlipQt package has
been installed.
